{% hint style="info" %}
**`Package leaflets`** are included in the packaging of medicinal products and contain information to help patients use the product safely and appropriately.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Contribution

* Introduced biomedical dataset `BioLeaflets`
* Provide base model using Transformer to generate multi-sentence text from the dataset.

### Dataset Generation

> Dataset is generated from package leaflets contents. The content of each section is not standardized, yet it is still well-structured.
